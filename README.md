# What's this project about?

This project aims to display an ordered list of pokemons with information such as name, dex number, and types. If you select one of the pokemon the application will validate if that pokemon has an evolution. If it does, it will direct you to a page with the pokemon's evolution chain.

## What has it got?

- This project was developed using the Cells framework.
- This project uses components from the BBVA library.
- The operation and visualization of the application is done through UI components for the representation of information and DM components for the management of data provided by the Pok√©Api API.
